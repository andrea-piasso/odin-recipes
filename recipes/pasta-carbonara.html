    <h2>A plate of our final recipe: <strong> Spaghetti alla Carbonara </strong> </h2>
    <p>Pasta alla carbonara is a classic Italian pasta dish that originated in Rome. 
    The dish is made with spaghetti or another long pasta, and the sauce is a creamy, rich mixture of eggs, Parmesan cheese, and crispy bits of pancetta or guanciale (cured pork jowl).</p>
    <p>The result is a simple yet delicious pasta dish with a rich and indulgent sauce. 
    It's a popular choice in Italian restaurants around the world, and is often served with a sprinkle of black pepper and additional Parmesan cheese on top.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients (for two)</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>160 gr Spaghetti (or other pasta shapes)</li>
        <li>60 gr guanciale</li>
        <li>2 egg yolks and 1 full egg</li>
        <li>25 gr Pecorino Romano cheese</li>
        <li>black pepper and salt</li>
        <li>additional parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the spaghetti and cook according to the package instructions until al dente.</li>
        <li>While the pasta is cooking, heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add the guanciale and cook until crispy, about 8-10 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the eggs and Pecorino cheese until well combined. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>Once the pasta is cooked, reserve 1 cup of the pasta water, then drain the pasta.</li>
        <li>Add the pasta to the skillet with the guanciale and toss to combine.</li>
        <li>Slowly pour the egg mixture over the pasta, stirring constantly to prevent the eggs from scrambling. Add the reserved pasta water, a little at a time, until the sauce becomes creamy and coats the pasta.</li>
        <li>Serve hot with additional Parmesan cheese on top.</li>
        <li>Enjoy your meal!</li>
    </ol>
